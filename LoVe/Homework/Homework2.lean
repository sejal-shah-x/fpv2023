/- # FPV Homework 2: Backward Proofs

In this homework, you'll practice writing *backward* (or *tactical*) proofs.

Homework must be done in accordance with the course policies on collaboration
and academic integrity.

Replace the placeholders (e.g., `:= sorry`) with your solutions. When you are
finished, submit *only* this file to the appropriate Gradescope assignment.
Remember that the autograder does not determine your final grade. -/

/- ## Question 1 (3 points): Connectives and Quantifiers

Complete the following proofs using basic tactics such as
`intro`, `apply`, and `exact`.

Hint: Some strategies for carrying out such proofs are described at the end of
Section 3.3 in the Hitchhiker's Guide. 

Think about the similarity to the type inhabitation problems of HW1!
-/

@[autograded 1] theorem B (a b c : Prop) :
  (a → b) → (c → a) → c → b :=
  sorry

@[autograded 1] theorem S (a b c : Prop) :
  (a → b → c) → (a → b) → a → c :=
  sorry

@[autograded 1] theorem more_nonsense (a b c : Prop) :
  (c → (a → b) → a) → c → b → a :=
  sorry


/- For an extra challenge: translate the `weak_peirce` type inhabitation 
problem from HW1 into a theorem statement, and prove the theorem! -/



/- ## Question 2 (5 points): Logical Connectives

2.1 (1 point). Prove the following property about implication using basic
tactics.

Hints:

* Keep in mind that `¬ a` is defined as `a → False`. You can start by invoking
  `rw [Not]` if this helps you.

* You will need to apply the elimination rule for `∨` and the elimination rule
  for `False` at some point in the proof. -/

@[autograded 1] theorem about_Impl (a b : Prop) :
  ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  sorry

/- 2.2 (2 points). 

The logical rules we have seen so far describe *intuitionistic* logic.
There are some statements that we can't prove using only these rules,
despite them perhaps "seeming" true.
(Food for thought: how could I argue that we *can't* prove certain propositions?)

Intuitionistic logic is extended to *classical* logic by assuming a classical
axiom, that allows us to prove these missing statements. 
There are several possibilities for the choice of axiom. In this
question, we are concerned with the logical equivalence of three different
axioms: -/

def ExcludedMiddle : Prop :=
  ∀a : Prop, a ∨ ¬ a

def Peirce : Prop :=
  ∀a b : Prop, ((a → b) → a) → a

def DoubleNegation : Prop :=
  ∀a : Prop, (¬¬ a) → a

/- For the proofs below, avoid using theorems from Lean's `Classical` namespace.


We will prove the equivalence of these axioms: each one implies the others.

Hints:

* One way to find the definitions of `DoubleNegation` and `ExcludedMiddle`
  quickly is to

  1. hold down the Control (on Linux and Windows) or Command (on macOS) key;
  2. move the cursor to the identifier `DoubleNegation` or `ExcludedMiddle`;
  3. click the identifier.

* You can use `rw [DoubleNegation]` to unfold the definition of
  `DoubleNegation`, and similarly for the other definitions.

* You will need to apply the double negation hypothesis for `a ∨ ¬ a`. You will
  also need the left and right introduction rules for `∨` at some point. -/

#check DoubleNegation
#check ExcludedMiddle

@[autograded 2] theorem EM_of_DN :
  DoubleNegation → ExcludedMiddle :=
  sorry


/-

In this week's lab, you'll have the option to prove a few more implications.
We state them `sorry`ed here, for reference and use;
you don't need to prove these for this homework.

-/

theorem Peirce_of_EM :
  ExcludedMiddle → Peirce :=
  sorry

theorem DN_of_Peirce :
  Peirce → DoubleNegation :=
  sorry


/- 2.3 (2 points). We have three of the six possible implications
between `ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation`. State and prove the
three missing implications, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/

/-! ## Question 3 (3 points): Equality

You may hear it said that equality is the smallest *reflexive*, *symmetric*, 
*transitive* relation. The following exercise shows that in the presence of 
reflexivity, the rules for symmetry and transitivity are equivalent to a single
rule, "symmtrans". -/

@[legalAxiom] axiom symmtrans {A : Type} {a b c : A} : a = b → c = b → a = c

-- You can now use `symmtrans` as a rule.

example (A : Type) (a b c : A) (h1 : a = b) (h2 : c = b) : a = c := by
  apply symmtrans
  apply h1
  apply h2


section

variable {A : Type}
variable {a b c : A}

/-! Replace the `sorry`s below with proofs, using `symmtrans` and `rfl`, without
using `Eq.symm`, `Eq.trans`, or `Eq.subst`. You should not use any tactics
besides `apply`, `exact`, and `rfl`. -/

@[autograded 1] theorem my_symm (h : b = a) : a = b :=
  sorry

@[autograded 2] theorem my_trans (h1 : a = b) (h2 : b = c) : a = c :=
  sorry

end


/-! ## Question 4 (3 points): Pythagorean Triples

A Pythagorean triple is a "triple" of three natural numbers `a`,
`b`, and `c` such that `a² + b² = c²`, i.e., they are integer sides of a right
triangle. -/

def IsPythagoreanTriple (a b c : ℕ) : Prop :=
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2

/-! By assuming Fermat's Last Theorem
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem), we can show that if
`a`, `b`, and `c` form a Pythagorean triple, then `a`, `b`, and `c` can't all be
perfect squares. Use the definitions below to prove this. -/

@[legalAxiom] axiom fermats_last_theorem (x y n : ℕ) :
  (n ≥ 3) → ¬∃ (z : ℕ), x^n + y^n = z^n

def IsSquare (n : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ (u : ℕ), n = u^2

-- **Note**: You may use the following lemma in your proof.
lemma square_square (a b c : ℕ) :
  (a^2)^2 + (b^2)^2 = (c^2)^2 → a^4 + b^4 = c^4 := 
by intro h; rw [←pow_mul, ←pow_mul, ←pow_mul] at h; exact h

/-! Hints:
* `And.elim` behaves a bit weirdly. If you want to extract proofs of `P` and `Q`
  from a proof of a conjunction `h : P ∧ Q`, use `h.elim` rather than
  `And.elim h`.
* If you have a hypothesis `h : a = b` and want to replace `b` with `a` in your
  goal (instead of `a` with `b`), use `rw [←h]` (note the `←`).
* You can use the `decide` tactic to prove that `4 ≥ 3`.

Note: You may not use `simp` in your solution. (If you need to expand a
definition, you can use `rw`.) -/

@[autograded 3] theorem pythagorean_triple_not_all_squares (a b c : ℕ) :
  IsPythagoreanTriple a b c → ¬(IsSquare a ∧ IsSquare b ∧ IsSquare c) :=
