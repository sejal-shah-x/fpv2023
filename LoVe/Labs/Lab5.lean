Replace the placeholders (e.g., `:= sorry`) with your solutions. -/

/- ## Question 1: Even and Odd

The `Even` predicate is `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers. -/

#check Even

/- We define `Odd` as the negation of `Even`: -/

def Odd (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ¬ Even n

/- 1.1. Prove that 1 is odd and register this fact as a simp rule.

Hint: `cases` or `induction` is useful to reason about hypotheses of the form
`Even …`. -/

@[simp] theorem Odd_1 :
  Odd 1 :=
  sorry

/- 1.2. Prove that 3 and 5 are odd. -/

/- 1.3. Complete the following proof by structural induction. -/

theorem Even_two_times :
  ∀m : ℕ, Even (2 * m)
  | 0     => Even.zero
  | m + 1 =>
    sorry


/- ## Question 2: Tennis Games

Recall the inductive type of tennis scores from the demo: -/

#check Score

/- 2.1. Define an inductive predicate that returns `True` if the server is
ahead of the receiver and that returns `False` otherwise. -/

inductive ServAhead : Score → Prop

/- 2.2. Validate your predicate definition by proving the following theorems. -/

theorem ServAhead_vs {m n : ℕ} (hgt : m > n) :
  ServAhead (Score.vs m n) :=
  sorry

theorem ServAhead_advServ :
  ServAhead Score.advServ :=
  sorry

theorem not_ServAhead_advRecv :
  ¬ ServAhead Score.advRecv :=
  sorry

theorem ServAhead_gameServ :
  ServAhead Score.gameServ :=
  sorry

theorem not_ServAhead_gameRecv :
  ¬ ServAhead Score.gameRecv :=
  sorry

/- 2.3. Compare the above theorem statements with your definition. What do you
observe? -/

/- ## Question 3: Binary Trees

3.1. Prove the converse of `IsFull_mirror`. You may exploit already proved
theorems (e.g., `IsFull_mirror`, `mirror_mirror`). -/

#check IsFull_mirror
#check mirror_mirror

theorem mirror_IsFull {α : Type} :
  ∀t : BTree α, IsFull (mirror t) → IsFull t :=
  sorry

/- 3.2. Define a `map` function on binary trees, similar to `List.map`. -/

def BTree.map {α β : Type} (f : α → β) : BTree α → BTree β
:=   sorry

/- 3.3. Prove the following theorem by case distinction. -/

theorem BTree.map_eq_empty_iff {α β : Type} (f : α → β) :
  ∀t : BTree α, BTree.map f t = BTree.empty ↔ t = BTree.empty
:=   sorry

/- 3.4. Prove the following theorem by rule induction. -/

theorem BTree.map_mirror {α β : Type} (f : α → β) :
  ∀t : BTree α, IsFull t → IsFull (BTree.map f t) :=
  sorry
